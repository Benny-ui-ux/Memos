# Memos
A web-based memo/note-taking service

You'll need to install flask and its dependencies in a python virtual environment. 

Make sure you also create a .env file with a 'Secret Key' a username and password (This will allow you to secure your entries on the web using login.html)

When you run the app, it will initialize the neccessary databases, and allow you to make memos, make journal entries, and take notes.
